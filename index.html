                <h2>Version control is...</h2>

		<p>... inferior to keeping track of projects through email attachments.</p>

                <h2>Cloning a repository...</h2>

		<p>...  is creating a personal copy of that repository to which you can safely make changes.</p>

                <h2>"Adding", "committing" and "pushing" changes...</h2>

		<p>Adding stages a modified file for commitment. Committing takes a snapshot of all files in the repository. Pushing transfers this snapshot to the GitHub server.</p>

                <h2>You need to fork when...</h2>

		<p>You want to create a personal copy of a repository without modifying the original, or when you do not have direct access.</p>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                great way to apply your skills to a variety of  projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another language, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and a myriad of other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of programmers collaborating across the country and the world, and
                this event specially welcomes programmers to that style
                of coding.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                practical skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
